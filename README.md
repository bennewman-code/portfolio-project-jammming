Projext Title - Jammming

Description - The main purpose of this web app was to understand how to use React and how to do api calls.
              There is no real problem this web app solves it's just a good learning tool for myself on how to do api calls.

Features - This web app features the ability to login to spotify then procede to search any song see the cover art, name and artist of the song, you then
           get too choose which songs to add to a playlist when youve added the songs you want youll be able to name the playlist then save it too your
           spotify account.

How to use - Check the React section of this ReadMe file to understand how to start the app.
             The only thing youll need to do youself is go to spotify for developers then go to the dashboard press create app.
             You can name it whatever you want same with other prompts the only one that matters is the redirect uri's, you can get that by going to src folder on the app
             then opening authorisation.js then on the third line take the url from that exactly and add it to the app.
             Then tick web api and terms and conditions then create.
             Finally last step is to take the clientId they give you and go back to that same file then go to the second line and replace the text with it.
             Then follow the prompts from the React section bellow to start the local server.

Collaborators - Benjamin Newman other then myself I used Ai to understand some of the harder stuff but I tried to stay away to stop it from hindering my learning
                I also frequented StackOver flow for some similar errors

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
